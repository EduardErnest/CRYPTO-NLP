### Financial Sentiment

Stock and Decentralised financial markets rely on a set of information about specific companies. This knowledge helps retail investors alongside institutional investors to determine whether to buy, hold, or sell off their positions. Until most recently, sentiment analysis was not regarded as a deal breaker or rain maker amongst the investors. But with the rise of famous Tweets made by the likes of **Elon Musk** and **Reddit's** infamous **r/wallstreetbets** this has changed the current climate and this is only just starting..........



Various **NLP** methods are being developed as we speak, but one of the most interesting approaches is **FinBERT** , which is a public library that uses a subset of financial news from Reuters. For sentiment classification, it uses Financial PhraseBank, which has over 4,000 sentences labeled by people with backgrounds in business and finance. Unlike regular sentiment analysis, where posi‐ tive means that something is of positive emotion, in Financial PhraseBank, a positive sentiment indicates that the stock price of the company will increase based on the news in the sentence.
